This package implements in R the Classifier-Lasso method by

Su, L., Shi, Z., & Phillips, P. C. (2016): ["Identifying latent structures in panel data"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/ECTA12560),  *Econometrica*, *84*(6), 2215-2264.



*This package is under active development...*



Code of the classifier-Lasso method was originally developed in `MATLAB` using `CVX` as the modeling language and `MOSEK` as the convex solver. Here is [replicable empirical examples](https://zhentaoshi.github.io/C-Lasso) in the paper. 

The package uses an open source solver  [ECOS](https://github.com/embotech/ecos) via [CVXR](https://github.com/anqif/CVXR) by default. We skipped the Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP) check steps to speed up the optimization.

To further speed up the computation, an R version using `Rmosek` to directly invoke `MOSEK` is elaborated in ["Implementing Convex Optimization in R: Two Econometric Examples"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326029597_Implementing_Convex_Optimization_in_R_Two_Econometric_Examples) with [demonstration code](https://github.com/zhan-gao/convex_prog_in_econometrics). In our experiments, this `R+Rmosek` implementation often solves the optimization problem with at most 1/3 of the time by the `MATLAB+CVX+MOSEK` implementation and at most 2/3 of the time by `CVXR+ECOS` implementation without DCP check.



## Installation

The current beta version can be installed from [Github](https://CRAN.R-project.org) by:

``` r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("zhan-gao/classo", INSTALL_opts=c("--no-multiarch"))
library(classo)
```

Though not required for installation and use, `Rmosek` is highly recommended. According to our extensive experience, using `Rmosek` is often much faster than R with other solvers. 

An installation gist of `MOSEK` can be found at [here](https://gist.github.com/mikelove/67ea44d5be5a053e599257fe357483dc ).
The installation of the latest version `MOSEK 9.0` includes `Rmosek`. It can be invoked in `R` following [this instruction](<https://docs.mosek.com/9.0/rmosek/install-interface.html>) (Tested with success).

Alternatively, `Rmosek` can be downloaded from CRAN. We have tested with success on R 3.6.3 the following lines:

``` r
install.packages("Rmosek")
library(Rmosek)
mosek_attachbuilder("path_to_the_bin_folder_of_MOSEK")
install.rmosek()
``` 

 *Please make sure `Rmosek` is successfully installed and activated before use `PLS.mosek()` function to do estimation*. 

## Examples

The sample data is generated by DGP 1 described in Su, Shi and Phillips (2016) with N = 200 and T = 25.

```r
data("sample_data")
# CAVEAT: Please convert data.frame to matrix to proceed.
y <- as.matrix(sample_data[, 1])
x <- as.matrix(sample_data[, -1])
n <- 200
tt <- 25
lambda <- as.numeric( 0.5 * var(y) / (tt^(1/3)) )
pls_out <- PLS.cvxr(n, tt, y, x, K = 3, lambda = lambda)

# Use Rmosek if it is successfully installed
# pls_out <- PLS.mosek(n, tt, y, x, K = 3, lambda = lambda)

# estimated slope for each group. True coefficients: [1,1; 0.4,1.6; 1.6,0.4]
pls_out$a.out 
```
